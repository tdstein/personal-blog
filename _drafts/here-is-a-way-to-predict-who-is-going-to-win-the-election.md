title: Here is a way to predict who is going to win the election.
---
Take the winners of each of the past two elections, which may be one or two presidents. Place them on the circumference of a circle with a distance along the rim between them so that space represents the Overton Window's size. The radius of the ring is representative of the size of the Overton Window. To pick the candidate that is most likely to win the next election, take the point opposite the original two so that when lines are drawn between them, they form an equilateral triangle. Then draw a line between the center of the circle and the third point so that the line intersects with the opposing side of the triangle at a perpendicular. 

Then select a point on the line outside of the rim. Place it so that the distance to the rim's edge is the distance that the Overton Window has grown or shrunk, divided by X, where X is the predicted or current center of the Overton Window.

Note that a larger circle is assumed since you want the human race to continue to prosper.

Given the candidates' current field, the candidate plotted closest to this point will win the election. 

To determine the Overton Window's length, perform the same calculation on the past three elections. 

And so, it is evident that the electorate will elect incumbents if more than half of the electorate is satisfied that the human race is prospering more, now, than it was in the time since the last election. However, the candidate may need to campaign since nobody is perfect. 

When the system begins moving in the opposite direction, so that the circle is shrinking, chaos is upon us if society cannot restabilize in a way that makes the electoral majority is prosperous.

If the Overton Window is not changing, everyone is happy.
