title: Planning for a Van Conversion
---

We are moving to Bloomington, IN in about a year. Candace took a job down there, so off we go. I don't plan on making any major career changes, but this will be an opportunity to set some roots. I'll have a home base that I can depend on for a couple of years. I can finally start working on some larger projects. The first one is a van conversion.

I've been researching the topic for the last six months. I read through two books, about a hundred hours of YouTube videos, and lost track of Instagram, Reddit, and various blogs. 

Here is what I know so far:

1. I don't want to live in a van full time.
1. I want whatever comes with having a van.
1. I have the skills to perform a van conversion.
1. Two people can travel in a van comfortably.
1. It's weird.

I mentioned I read a few books on the subject:

- ["How to live in a van and travel: Live everywhere, be free and have adventures in a campervan or motorhome"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35403719-how-to-live-in-a-van-and-travel) by Mike Hudson
- ["How to Live in a Car, Van or RV -- And Get Out of Debt, Travel and Find True Freedom"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18858458-how-to-live-in-a-car-van-or-rv--and-get-out-of-debt-travel-and-find-tr?from_search=true) by Bob Wells

These books went into the details of what it is like to live in a van full-time. Both authors described how the #vanlife provided them with financial and social freedom. For Mike, it was the ability to leave the job he didn't like. And for Bob, it was a way to keep off the streets during financial collapse and a messy divorce. I'm not in either of these situations.

More to come...
