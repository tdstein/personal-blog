When we meet someone for the first time they often ask: "What do you do?" When that line is thrown in my direction, I hesitate and respond: "I work in software... blah... blah... blah..." What I wish I could say is: "I'm an adventurer."

So, I am a software engineer on my way to becoming a full-time adventurer.

One of my co-workers once declared I have the best documentation. I took that feedback and decided to make a hobby out of it. On this blog, I'm documenting my journey. I'm also sharing tutorials, how-to guides and product reviews on the tools I use. If I do my job right, they will help you do what I'm doing faster.
