I am a software engineer and wannabe full-time adventure. I was once told that I have the best documentation, so I decided to make a hobby out of it.

If you have ever dreamed about optimizing your life around adventuring, you are in the right place. I'm transitioning from a full-time software engineer to a full-time adventurer who writes software as much as he likes.

I'm documenting my journey. I'm also sharing tutorials, how-to guides and product reviews on the tools I use. If I do my job right, they will help you do what I'm doing faster.
